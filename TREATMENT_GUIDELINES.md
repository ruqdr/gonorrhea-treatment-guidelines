# Gonorrhea Treatment Guidelines
## Current Recommendations (as of 2021)

### First-line Therapy
- **Uncomplicated urogenital, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea**:
  - Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose
  - PLUS Azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose

### Alternative Regimens (if ceftriaxone unavailable)
- Cefixime 800 mg orally as a single dose
  - PLUS Azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose

### Special Populations
- **Pregnant patients**: Same as first-line therapy; avoid tetracyclines.
- **Allergic to cephalosporins**: Consult infectious disease specialist.

### Follow-up
- Test-of-cure not routinely recommended unless symptoms persist.
- Rescreen at 3 months post-treatment due to high reinfection risk.

### Notes
- Dual therapy is recommended to slow resistance development.
- Monitor local susceptibility patterns annually.
